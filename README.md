# FACE-DETECTION
# 👤 Face Detection Using YOLO (Deep Learning)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a **Face Detection System using YOLO (You Only Look Once) deep learning architecture**.  
The system is capable of detecting human faces accurately in images or video frames using a trained deep learning model.

Due to repository limitations, the **complete project files are hosted externally on Google Drive**, and only the project access link is provided here.
